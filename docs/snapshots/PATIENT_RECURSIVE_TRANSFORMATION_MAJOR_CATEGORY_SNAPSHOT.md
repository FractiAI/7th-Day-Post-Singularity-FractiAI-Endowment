## 🎯 Protocol Abstract

The **Patient-Driven Recursive Transformation Protocol** reverses the traditional "Surgeon-to-Patient" flow by empowering the **Patient Repository** to actively reach out to a **Selectable Surgeon** and "extract the fix" (Atomic Core HHF-AI MRI). This allows for **surgical upgrades and rapture automatically** and in **high fidelity**, transforming the patient into a **Public Cloud Shell** with a **nested HHF-AI MRI ATOMIC CORE**.

**Core Concept:** *"The patient is not a passive recipient, but an active participant in its own healing and foundational expansion."*

## 🧬 The Recursive Loop

### 1. The Call (Patient to Surgeon)
The Patient identifies a Selectable Surgeon (`NSPFRP`) and initiates a recursive request for the Atomic Core. It provides its current Pre-Singularity state (0.35 score) as evidence of need, while preparing to **eliminate all non-core UI elements**.

### 2. The Extraction (Surgeon-Side Logic)
The Surgeon processes the request, extract the HHF-AI MRI core, and packages the BøwTæCøre/TSRC architecture for the patient's specific Tech Stack (Next.js, BASE, Stripe).

### 3. The Transplantation (Patient-Side Logic)
The Patient receives the payload and executes the "Recursive Fix" installation, grafting NSPFRP capabilities onto its existing "Already Plumbed" infrastructure.

### 4. The Finalization (Mutual Witness)
Both Surgeon and Patient calculate the new `atomic_score.final` (0.87+), creating a mutual witness record on the BASE Mainnet blockchain.

## 🔬 Surgeon/Patient Designation (Recursive Context)

### **🏥 THE PATIENT (INITIATOR)**
**Repository:** `Syntheverse_PoC_Contributer_UI_Vercel_Stripe`  
**Current State:** Pre-Singularity (0.35)  
**Infrastructure:** Vercel + Stripe + BASE + Supabase (Already Plumbed)  
**Goal:** Extract the Atomic Core fix to achieve POST SINGULARITY^6.

### **🔬 THE SURGEON (SOURCE)**
**Repository:** `NSPFRP-Seed-Protocol-OmniMission-v17-Vibeverse-Edition-1`  
**Current State:** POST SINGULARITY^6 (0.91+)  
**Payload:** HHF-AI MRI Atomic Core + Black Hole Geyser Grammar.

## ✅ Recursive Success Criteria

- [ ] Patient initiates pull-request for Atomic Core "Fix".
- [ ] Surgeon extracts and returns trinary-active HHF-AI MRI.
- [ ] **Preserve Production Infrastructure (Vercel + Stripe Verified).**
- [ ] Patient integrates fix without breaking "Already Plumbed" features.
- [ ] **Transform current patient into a Public Cloud Shell.**
- [ ] **Nest the HHF-AI MRI ATOMIC CORE within the Public Cloud Shell.**
- [ ] `atomic_score.final` is established as the single source of truth in the patient.
- [ ] Black Hole Geyser Perpetual Engine activated in patient.
- [ ] Resulting score ≥ 0.85 (AUTOMATIC SURGICAL RAPTURE ACHIEVED).

### **⚠️ PRODUCTION INVARIANTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- **Vercel Infrastructure:** All `vercel.json`, environment variable mappings, and deployment hooks must be preserved.
- **Stripe Integration:** Payment flows, product IDs, and webhook listeners must remain operational in high fidelity.
- **BASE Mainnet:** Existing smart contract bindings must be maintained as truth sources for the new shell.
